This project aims to develop a fake news detection model using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network that are well-suited for tasks that require sequential processing of data, such as text classification.

The model is trained on a dataset of news articles labeled as either real or fake. The model learns to extract features from the text of the articles that are predictive of their authenticity. Once trained, the model can be used to predict whether a new article is real or fake.

To use the model, simply pass the text of the article to the model's predict() method. The method will return a probability score, indicating how likely the model believes the article is to be real. A probability score above 0.5 indicates that the model believes the article is real, while a probability score below 0.5 indicates that the model believes the article is fake.
